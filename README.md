This week we learned how to create a local or  a remote repository and how to manage that file from either source.  There are several steps needs to create a repository in a local drive and comitt it to a github account. Below are the steps along the commands needed to create a repo in a local drive and comitt to github. 

Step 1. Git init command 

type git init in the terminal (this could be git bash or powershell whichever is applicable). 

git init is a command that allows to set up a new git repository. 

Git clone = allows to reproduce or copy the whole repository folder from github (remote) to local repository. 

Git commit - saves changes and keeps the git repository upto date.

Git pull: allows to download current files from git repository to local repository. Thus keep local repo uptodate.
